        <p>  I was born and raised in Arizona.  I've been a web developer for about six years now, and during that time I've worked on dozens of websites and web-applications. I knew I loved code the moment I laid eyes on it. With the rest of my time I'm an avid motorcycle rider, musician (singer), and family oriented man that values quality time and a little adventure.</p><br>
        <p>Here's an example of an API call to instagram where I request my four most recent posts, parse through the data, pull out the urls to the thumb-nails and their respective widths, and populate img tags with some basic styling:</p>

  <div class="row">
    <% @instagram.each do |photo| %>
      <div class="col-md-3">
        <div class="about-img">
            <img src="<%= photo[0] %>" width="<%= photo[1] %>">
        </div>
      </div>
    <% end %>
