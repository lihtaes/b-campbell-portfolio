        <p>  Born and raised in Arizona, I've been in software for over seven years. During that time I've worked on numerous websites, web-applications, mobile apps, MVC frameworks, and more as a developer, lead, and project manager with countless tech tools and languages. I have learned that the strength and success of any endeavor is vitally hinged upon the respect for authority, humility, and upholding of those on either side of us, above us, and below us, as well as the quality and consistency of communication. Creating an environment that effectively balances enduring work ethic and professionalism with a lighthearted and family like security is paramount in bringing a vision of any worth to its fruition. I knew I loved code the moment I laid eyes on it, and my first job in the industry sealed the deal. Over the years I have come to value and respect the need for leadership and have asipired with vigilance to rise up and meet that need in each of my roles, both in and out of the professional arena. With the rest of my time I'm an avid motorcycle rider, musician, and family oriented man with high values and an exceptional moral aptitude. I love technology, and I love seeing humanity forge ahead in virtue and outward accomplishment, and I believe our future as a people is bright and worth fighting for.</p><br>
