        <p>  Born and raised in Arizona, I've been in software for over seven years. During that time I've worked on dozens of websites, web-applications, mobile apps, and even MVC frameworks as a developer, lead, and even project manager. I knew I loved code the moment I laid eyes on it. With the rest of my time I'm an avid motorcycle rider, musician (singer), and family oriented man with high values and moral aptitude. </p><br>
